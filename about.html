<p>Hi, I am Rathi. I am an engineer with a bachelorâ€™s degree in electronics and communications. Ever since I was a student in engineering, I was interested in web technologies and after moving to New York from India, I decided to further my education by learning to code and building my own apps. My favorite app to date is Instaphogram, which I built from beginning to end using Ruby on Rails. You can check out below in the projects section!</p>

<p>The beauty of web technology that I appreciate the most is its ability to connect the world through any platform and any device, and I love watching projects grow from nothing to a complete working module.</p>
