In the past few month after getting graduated from coding school I finaly took up new curve in learning new technology and that is about **Data Science: Deep learning in Python** With the interest in learning neural network I took my first step in the field of deep learning. 

**What is deep learning useful for ?**

* Like all machine learning: making pridiction it just that happens that its better than all the other approches
* Deep Learning does it better
* Some examples are:
      1. Self driving car
      2. Google search
      3. Recognizing faces in an image
      4. Stock Prediction 
**Outline of how and what I started learning:**
* Softmax: Going from binary classification to multi class classification 
* backpropagation:that is how to train a neural net
* neural network learning discriminating feature
* Googles Tensor flow Library: Plug and Play script
* Tensorflow Playground i:e to visulaize what a neural network is learning. 

I am excited to learn more and come up with the implementation of what I will learnt and write blog about it more, in my next blog I will write more on why Python was picked for among all other language.
