This week I had an interview for an associate role and they asked me question related to principals of Object oriented programming and What all I learnt while relating object oriented paradigm with real life scenario because that what object oriented programming means "Being able to relate to real life objects" 

**Important aspect of OOPs**

1. Object Represent real life entity.An instance created out of class. 
2. Class - Considered as Blue-print or in my word cookie cutter. Class holds all the specification of an instance created from it (which means holding in all the attributes(properties) and functionality of an object. 

**Pillar's of OOP's**

1.** Abstraction** : Means Taking in necessary details and ignoring the rest (i.e keeping only the required attributes and functionality in a class for creating an instance.)
2. **Encapsulation** : Keeping the data safe i.e being able to provide access specification to the data (attributes) available to the interface)
3. **Inheritance** : Stimulating real life scenario where a child inherit properties from his parent(i.e a child class can inherit all the properties from his parent class and can also have its on properties. 
4. **Polymorphism** :Same function when applied on different object gives different results.
