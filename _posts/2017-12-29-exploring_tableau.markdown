One first encounter to one of the latest data visualization tool which is tableau, I started with playing around at Tableau public software which you can get by going to `(https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) ` which has slite restrictions compare to having full licensed version which are:

* We cannot create extracts.
* We cannot save files directly to your computer but have to save it in tableau public server.

Which are not a big hurdle in terms of steping in to the new world of learning data visualizing tool while its very helpful as far as your are not dealing with sensitive data which you dont want to share to world.

So its about having a data either in the form of spread sheets and then we feed the data on to the tableau and further with the help of different tools we can process to data to show in a visualing appealing ways.

**What can be done using tableau?**

Many awsume things can be done using tableau and few such are:

* We can play around with color to separate datas,
* We can label, format our chart, exporting our work sheets

**Connecting Tableau to a Data file**

On the left side of the image we see *Connect*  there are different file type which we can connect to, while doing this course in Udemy I was provided with sets to data to play around with, so to explain what I learnt I will be using csv file.
CSV file is considered basically as text file( Comma separated value) which is text in nature.

Our second imge shows what happens when we select a csv file, and then we are directed to the connection manager for this data sourse

What can be done with these data  I will discuss in my next blog, till then keep coding!
