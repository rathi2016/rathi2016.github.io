**How I stumbled upon it-**

For a couple of weeks my desktop computer was running slowly and randomly hanging. One day after being truly fed up with it I ran a bunch of virus scans, what I found was that I was unknowingly part of the vast world of crypto currency mining and that my computer was the unwilling participant mining Bitcoin for someone on the internet.

**What is Bitcoin?**
Bitcoin is a crypto currency. There are many crypto currencies today, the main ones are Bitcoin, litecoin and peercoin. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It’s a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they are not backed by gold or turst in any governments. Because they are not issued by any government bitcoin can be nearly impossible to track or to regulate. Because because Bitcoins can be sent from a person to person without any transaction fees or the use of any financial institutions Bitcoin has quickly become currency of choice for many black and grey market transations.

**The growth of bitcoin**
Started in 2009 after the financial crisis the original Bitcoins which were worth less than a penny in 2010 are now worth more than 1000$ each, and are now worth more than gold. Insert chart of Bitcoin growth. As as you can see from the chart no other type of investment has had the kind of crazy returns over the last six years that Bitcoin has had!

Mining Bitcoin and becoming rich
In order to track the growing number of transations occurring with bitcoin and to ensure its integrity a tracking system was needed but without a bank or government. This is where bitcoin mining comes in. Unlike traditional currencies which can be only produced by Banks or Central government’s Bitcoins can be produced by anyone with a computer who’s willing to solve the mathematical questions required to be awarded a Bitcoin. In solving these complex mathematical equations the miners are also adding transaction records to Bitcoin's public ledger of past transactions . This ledger of past transactions is called the block chain. The block chain confirms transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from fraudulent ones. Additionally as a system of computers correctley solves these complex mathematical problems and writes data to the block chain they are awarded bitcoins. 

How can I mine Bitcoins ?
Essentially you need a computer with a powerful processor and GPU. There are technologies newer than GPU that are able to mine at a faster rate however these are specialized hardware that most regular people done have. 
1.	Download a Bitcoin wallet
2.	Join a mining pool
3.	Start mining and earn bitcoin.
4.	Beware it can be a slow, a time consuming process to mine bitcoin (similar to mining other valuable metals) and you may also lose more money in power consumption and hardware costs than you may gain in the value of bitcoin.
