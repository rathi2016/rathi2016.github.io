This blog is continuation of the last weeks blog which talks about my experience with using Tableau to help see and understand data. which is base to solve the problems. Tableau makes analyzing data fast and easy, beautiful and useful, well this became popular after most oftenly used tools by journalists are using Tableau to publish data stories to the web.

* Democratizing data allows people to think and act quickly, bringing transparency and agility to fact-based decision making.

* The data which we are working with in tableau does not always have to come from one file but it can come from many files or it can come from same file or many different type of file
