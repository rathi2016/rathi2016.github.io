I was busy writing code, catching up on my assignments, learning to balance myself on top of a tightrope, the task of writing a blog looming overhead, the stresses of life dancing within and Bollywood music pumping through my headphones. I was beginning to get overwhelmed. A tear welled up in my eye, waiting to fall, however, it did not. I stepped back off the rope and thought about the journey I just completed.



The beautiful journey I went on in the past year. My first ever blog, one more thing added to the list of “My first-time moments”, in a year full of firsts.

From the first view of a sprawling New York City from the window of a Boeing 777 to the happiness, I felt when I got accepted into the Flatiron school it’s been a whirlwind of a year. We traveled to 5 different countries & visited 10 different cities. Along the way, I ate things I could have never dreamed of eating. Smelled new smells, saw unbelievable things and enjoyed every moment.

 

A few of the things I did for the first time ever!

* Got married (first time ever!)

* A wind blew in my direction and I froze instantly!

* Walked across a bridge for the first time, and that too the famed Brooklyn bridge.

* Went to the UN Assembly Hall, and there, on the Indian Independence day; I got to see a concert by the legendary A.R Rahman. (Slumdog millionaire, Singer, and Music Director)
  

* First time at the World Trade center and I also got to be part of the opening of the Oculus Transit Hub.

* First time I heard about baseball was when I was at Yankee stadium watching a game!
* Visited Niagara Falls and walked across the rainbow bridge to a different country
* Got to play in the snow and had snowball fights!

* I always loved dogs and never liked cats strange, Now I have 3 cats!

* Learning to code and more importantly learning from all of you.
